# Vacation Wishlist Management System

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is build a desktop application that helps to organize vacation planning related items such as attractions to see,
transportations, and specific restaurants that one wishes to visit.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, many people's vacation plans were put on hold.
As recreational travel slowly opens back up, I have found myself researching about potential vacations and attractions in the hopes that I can visit them after the restrictions have been lifted.
However, I find that it is difficult to keep track of the different vacation related items as they can come from many sources such as blogs, youtube videos, or facebook posts.
This desktop application can be used by anyone who wished to plan and keep track of their vacations but can also serve as a wishlist tracker for travel items.

This project interests me as I look forward to the return of recreational travel and I am sure I am not the only one. 
This project can be the beginning of a platform to help travel lovers keep track of their travel wishlists and quickly plan their trips once the travel restrictions are lifted.
