# Course Management System

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is build a desktop application that helps students to keep track of course assignments, deadlines, and other course related activities.

I often find that the courses at UBC tend to use different technologies across different faculties such as webwork, gradescope, edx, etc. 
This causes the course material to scattered across different platforms which might cause confusion. 
Different course also tend to use different methods of communications such as Canvas notifications, emails, or piazza posts.
This application is designed for students to stay organized by providing a top-down view of all the courses and keep track of all the course updates in one place.

I often struggle to stay organized in my courses. I have tried using organization apps in the past but I have not found one that is designed for students.
The ideal application will be flexible enough for the user to customize the view of the courses and be able to connect in some way to the different technologies used by different courses.
